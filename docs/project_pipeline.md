# Project Pipeline

If you are looking for things to do, you can look on the [projects page](https://github.com/NovaMods/nova-rs/projects)
of Nova Renderer to look for all current tasks that need to be completed.

These tasks are as cards before anyone starts working on them. When you start working on
a particular project you should turn the card into an issue, mentioning the branch you are
going to use for development on that feature.

Once changes are ready for review, submit a PR that is classified in the same category as the issue.
Make sure in your PR message you include the line `closes #N` so that the feature issue is automagically
closed.
